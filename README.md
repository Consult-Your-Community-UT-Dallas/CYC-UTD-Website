# Consult Your Community Website

Welcome to Consult Your Community, a student-led organization at UT Dallas dedicated to providing free consulting services to small, minority-owned businesses and nonprofits in the Dallas area. Our mission is to make a positive social impact by leveraging our skills and knowledge to support local communities.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. 
- **Backend:** Python FastAPI is responsible for handling form submissions and sending emails.

## Getting Started

Make sure you have the following software installed on your machine:

-   Node.js
-   Python

> [!NOTE]  
> Make sure you have a Python environment set up for this repository. You can use `virtualenv` or `conda` to create a new environment.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Consult-Your-Community-UT-Dallas/CYC-UTD-Website
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Consult-Your-Community-UT-Dallas
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The majority of the website's content can be found within the `/data` directory.

## Deployment

Since the repository is under a GitHub organization and Vercel's enterprise plan is too costly, one of the members of the organization must deploy it manually using their account.
