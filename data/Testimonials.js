                    &quot;Thanks to CYC&apos;s student volunteers, my online store and social media strategy got a significant boost last summer. Working with a
                    dedicated team was a game-changer for my solo venture at Postscript San Francisco.

                    &quot;I joined CYC due to my parents&apos; small business challenges. CYC&apos;s mission resonated with me as we faced difficulties without
                    knowing where to seek help.

                    Immigrant-owned businesses, like my parents&apos;, often struggle to adapt, and CYC&apos;s regional insights could have been invaluable for
